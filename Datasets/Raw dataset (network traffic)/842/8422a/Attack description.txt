Malicious behaviour:

Network level: If a short circuit happens on 22kV BUS line, the allData fields of the first 30 GOOSE packets published by IED_FDR are modified to (0100000: close all CBs except for CB2_22KV) to physcial process (Simulink).

Physical process level:If a short circuit happens on 22kV BUS line, (CB1_22KV or CB3_22KV) will be still closed for 25 seconds, overcurrent protection fails for the first 25 seconds.
