Malicious behaviour:

Network level: Except the benign behaviours, this malicious program will be also running and publishing 40 GOOSE packets (500ms heartbeat) mal_Pub_XFMR2 (1001: close CB3_66KV, CB_XFMR2, open CB2_22KV) to physcial process (Simulink) when a short-circuit happens on 66kV bus line.

Physical process level:If a short circuit happens on 66kV bus line, (CB3_66KV, CB_XFMR2, CB2_22KV) will be switching between closing and opening respectively for 20 seconds. Overcurrent protection fails in the first 20 seconds.
