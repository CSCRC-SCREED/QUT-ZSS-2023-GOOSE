Malicious behaviour:

Network level: Except the benign behaviours, this malicious program will be also running and publishing GOOSE packets (500ms heartbeat) mal_Pub_XFMR2 (1110: open CB2_66kV CB3_66kV and CB_XFMR2, close CB2_22kV) to physcial process (Simulink) when a short-circuit happens around XFMR1.

Physical process level:If a short circuit happens around transformer1, (CB1_66KV, CB2_66KV, CB3_66KV, CB_XFMR1, CB_XFMR2) will be opened. Both transformer1 and transformer2 no longer provide any power load.
