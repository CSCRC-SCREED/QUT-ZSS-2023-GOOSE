## Scenario 862
In this scenario, the malicious program subscribes to all types of SV messages illegitimately and publishes tripping signals even when a short-circuit fault happens in an irrelevant location. Such an attack will mislead other irrelevant circuit breakers with opening signals to deteriorate the impacts of the short-circuit fault. The scenario contains a total of ${\color{red}four}$ sub-scenarios, which are combinations of ${\color{red}two}$ attack targets and ${\color{red}two}$ attack configurations.

**QUTZS.pcapng is the primary data, QUTZS_Redundant.pcapng is for redundancy purpose.**

1. **${\color{red}Two}$ attack targets**: 
   - **a**: disrupting the power supply through CB3_22KV when a short-circuit fault happens in Fault_22bus1
   - **b**: disrupting the power supply through CB1_22KV when a short-circuit fault happens in Fault_22bus2
2. **${\color{red}Two}$ attack configurations**:
   - **8621**: when a short-circuit fault happens, an irrelevant IED (compromised with malicious program) publishes packets containing tripping signals until the fault is eliminated and the systems recover
   - **8622**: when a short-circuit fault happens, an irrelevant IED (compromised with malicious program) publishes the first 30 packets containing tripping signals, and the rest packets containing non-tripping signals
