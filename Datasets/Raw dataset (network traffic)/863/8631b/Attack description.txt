Malicious behaviour:

Network level: If a short circuit happens on either Feeder1 or Feeder2, the allData fields of GOOSE packets published by IED_FDR are modified to (0101100) (open CB2_22kV CB_FDR1, CB_FDR2) to physcial process (Simulink).

Physical process level:If a short circuit happens on either Feeder1 or Feeder2, (CB2_22kV CB_FDR1, CB_FDR2) will be opened. Both Feeder1 or Feeder2 are no longer supplied with any power load.
