Malicious behaviour:

Network level: Except the benign behaviours, this malicious program will be also running and publishing GOOSE packets (500ms heartbeat) mal_Pub_FDR (0100000: close all CBs except for CB2_22KV) to physcial process (Simulink) when a short-circuit happens on 22kV BUS line.

Physical process level:If a short circuit happens on 22kV BUS line, (CB1_22KV or CB3_22KV) will be switching between closing and opening. Overcurrent protection fails.
