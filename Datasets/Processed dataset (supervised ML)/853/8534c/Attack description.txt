Malicious behaviour:

Network level: Except the benign behaviours, this malicious program will be also running and publishing 30 GOOSE packets (with 1,4,16,64,256,1000ms HB) mal_Pub_FDR (0100001: open CB2_22KV, CB_FDR4) to physcial process (Simulink) when a short-circuit happens around Feeder3.

Physical process level:If a short circuit happens around Feeder3, (CB_FDR3, CB_FDR4) will be opened for almost 25 seconds. Both Feeder3 and Feeder4 are no longer supplied with any power load for the first 25 seconds.
