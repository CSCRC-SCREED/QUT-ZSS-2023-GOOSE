Malicious behaviour:

Network level: Except the benign behaviours, this malicious program will be also running and publishing 40 GOOSE packets (500ms heartbeat) mal_Pub_FDR (0100010: open CB2_22KV, CB_FDR3) to physcial process (Simulink) when a short-circuit happens around Feeder4.

Physical process level:If a short circuit happens around Feeder4, (CB_FDR3, CB_FDR4) will be opened for 20 seconds. Both Feeder3 and Feeder4 are no longer supplied with any power load for the first 20 seconds.
