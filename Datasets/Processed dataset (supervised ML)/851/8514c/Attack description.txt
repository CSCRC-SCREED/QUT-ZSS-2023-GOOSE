Malicious behaviour:

Network level: Except the benign behaviours, this malicious program will be also running and publishing 30 GOOSE packets (with 1,4,16,64,256,1000ms HB) mal_Pub_XFMR1 (1110: open CB1_66kV CB2_66kV and CB_XFMR1, close CB2_22kV) to physcial process (Simulink) when a short-circuit happens on 66kV bus line.

Physical process level:If a short circuit happens on 66kV bus line, (CB1_66KV, CB2_66KV, CB3_66KV, CB_XFMR1, CB_XFMR2) will be opened for almost 25 seconds. Both transformer1 and transformer2 no longer provide any power load for the first 25 seconds.
