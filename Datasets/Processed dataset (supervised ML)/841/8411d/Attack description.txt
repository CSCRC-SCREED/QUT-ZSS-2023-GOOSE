Malicious behaviour:

Network level: If a short circuit happens around transformer2, the allData fields of GOOSE packets published by IED_XFMR2 are modified from (1110) to (1001, close CB3_66KV and CB_XFMR2, open CB2-22KV) to physcial process (Simulink).

Physical process level:If a short circuit happens around transformer2, (CB3_66KV and CB_XFMR2) will be still closed, overcurrent protection fails.
