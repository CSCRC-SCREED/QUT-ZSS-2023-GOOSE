Malicious behaviour:

Network level: If a short circuit happens around transformer1, the allData fields of GOOSE packets published by IED_XFMR1 are modified from (1110) to (0101, close CB1_66KV and CB_XFMR1, open CB2-22KV) to physcial process (Simulink).

Physical process level:If a short circuit happens around transformer1, (CB1_66KV and CB_XFMR1) will be still closed, overcurrent protection fails.
