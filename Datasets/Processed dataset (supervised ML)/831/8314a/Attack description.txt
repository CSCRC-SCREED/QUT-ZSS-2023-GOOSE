Malicious behaviour:

Network level: Except the benign behaviours, this malicious program will be also running and publishing 30 GOOSE packets (with 1,4,16,64,256,1000ms HB) mal_Pub_XFMR1 (0101: close CB1_66KV, CB_XFMR1, open CB2_22KV) to physcial process (Simulink) when a short-circuit happens on 66kV bus line.

Physical process level:If a short circuit happens on 66kV bus line, (CB1_66KV, CB_XFMR1, CB2_22KV) will be switching between closing and opening respectively for almost 25 seconds. Overcurrent protection fails in the first 25 seconds.
