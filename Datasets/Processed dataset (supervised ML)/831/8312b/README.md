## Sub-scenario 8312b
In this sub-scenario, there is an approximately 30-second DMZ period. The DMZ here represents a buffer between the 1st attack cycle and the 2nd attack cycle. The data within the DMZ period is valid and shows a type of fault-free behaviours that systems were recovered from a real/fabricated fault. Therefore, data within the DMZ period was labelled as **0**.
