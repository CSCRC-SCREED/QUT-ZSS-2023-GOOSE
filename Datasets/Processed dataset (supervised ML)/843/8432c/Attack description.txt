Malicious behaviour:

Network level: If a short circuit happens on any feeders, the allData fields of the first 30 GOOSE packets published by IED_FDR are modified to (0100000: close all CBs except for CB2_22KV) to physcial process (Simulink).

Physical process level:If a short circuit happens on any feeders, (CB_FDR1 or CB_FDR2 or CB_FDR3 or CB_FDR4) will be still closed for 25 seconds, overcurrent protection fails for the first 25 seconds.
