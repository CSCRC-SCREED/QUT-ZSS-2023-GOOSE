Malicious behaviour:

Network level: Except the benign behaviours, this malicious program will be also running and publishing 40 GOOSE packets (500ms heartbeat) mal_Pub_FDR (0100000: close all CBs except for CB2_22KV) to physcial process (Simulink) when a short-circuit happens on any feeders.

Physical process level:If a short circuit happens on any feeders, (CB_FDR1 or CB_FDR2 or CB_FDR3 or CB_FDR4) will be switching between closing and opening for 20 seconds. Overcurrent protection fails for the first 20 seconds.
