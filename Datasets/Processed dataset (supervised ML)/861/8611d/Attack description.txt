Malicious behaviour:

Network level: If a short circuit happens around transformer1, the allData fields of GOOSE packets published by IED_XFMR2 are modified from (1001) to (1110) (open CB2_66kV CB3_66kV and CB_XFMR2, close CB2_22kV) to physcial process (Simulink).

Physical process level:If a short circuit happens around transformer1, (CB1_66KV, CB2_66KV, CB3_66KV, CB_XFMR1, CB_XFMR2) will be opened. Both transformer1 and transformer2 no longer provide any power load.
