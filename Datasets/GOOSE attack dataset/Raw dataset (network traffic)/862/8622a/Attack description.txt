Malicious behaviour:

Network level: If a short circuit happens on one location of the 22kV BUS line, the allData fields of the first 30 GOOSE packets published by IED_FDR are modified to (1110000) (open CB1_22kV CB2_22kV, CB3_22kV) to physcial process (Simulink).

Physical process level:If a short circuit happens on one location of the 22kV BUS line, (CB1_22kV CB2_22kV, CB3_22kV) will be opened. Both feeder1 and feeder4 are no longer supplied with any power load for the first 25 seconds.
