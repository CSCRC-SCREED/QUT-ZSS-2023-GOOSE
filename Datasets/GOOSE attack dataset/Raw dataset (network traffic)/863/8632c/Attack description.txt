Malicious behaviour:

Network level: If a short circuit happens on either Feeder3 or Feeder4, the allData fields of the first 30 GOOSE packets published by IED_FDR are modified to (0100011) (open CB2_22kV CB_FDR3, CB_FDR4) to physcial process (Simulink)

Physical process level:If a short circuit happens on either Feeder3 or Feeder4, (CB2_22kV CB_FDR3, CB_FDR4) will be opened. Both Feeder3 and Feeder4 are no longer supplied with any power load for the first 25 seconds.
